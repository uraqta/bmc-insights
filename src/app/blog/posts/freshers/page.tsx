          The students at the British Model College worked tirelessly to throw a
          welcome party for the freshly incoming batch of students. “BMC
          Freshers 2024” was a massive success, and the students had a night to
          remember. It was a party organized by the A2 students, welcoming the
          new batch of AS students to the school at a party venue right next to
          the school. Mr. Rajan Kumar Rai started off the ceremony with a
          heartwarming speech, kicking the party off. This was followed by the
          opening dance, keeping the energy of the students high. Following
          that, more of the talented A2 students put up an impeccable line of
          items. Songs from “Thamel Bazar” to “One of the girls” flowed into the
          surroundings, making everyone sway with excitement. The atmosphere was
          lively, the crowd singing along and clapping, displaying the
          audience’s enthusiasm in getting involved with the performances.
          Traditional food was served at the party for snacks, and dinner was a
          flavourful combination of naan and butter chicken. Ice cream shortly
          followed after for dessert. However, the highlight of the night was
          the open dance floor towards the end of the event. Being somewhat a
          moshpit, with the sound system bursting with boisterous upbeat music,
          everybody jumped up and down, full of life. The party ended on a high,
          with all of the students feeling euphoric and talking to one another
          about the memorable night they had. <br></br> <br></br>
